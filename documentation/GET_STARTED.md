# 🚀 Get Started in 3 Steps

## The Fastest Way to Start Finding Compelling Movie Scenes

---

## What You'll Get

A system that finds 1-2 minute movie scenes that:
- ✅ Are viral-worthy for social media
- ✅ Are story-significant and compelling
- ✅ Make viewers want to watch the full movie!

**Trained on 34,000+ professionally curated movie highlights from CondensedMovies dataset.**

---

## 3-Step Quick Start

### Step 1: Activate Environment (30 seconds)

```bash
cd /Users/ddash/Desktop/hackathon/condensed_movies_integration
source ../viral_clip_env/bin/activate
```

### Step 2: Run Quick Start Script (5 minutes)

```bash
bash QUICK_START.sh
```

Choose option 1 (Dummy data test) to verify everything works.

### Step 3: Find Compelling Scenes in Your Video

```bash
python scripts/4_ensemble_scene_finder.py \
    --video /path/to/your/movie.mp4 \
    --output output/my_clips
```

**That's it!** Your clips will be in `output/my_clips/`

## What Each File Does

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **README.md** | Complete overview and architecture |
| **SETUP_GUIDE.md** | Detailed setup instructions (3 paths) |
| **USAGE_EXAMPLES.md** | Real-world usage examples |

## Three Training Paths

### 🚀 Path 1: Dummy Test (5 min)
**Best for:** Verifying setup works

```bash
bash QUICK_START.sh
# Choose option 1
```

**Result:** Working system with dummy model

---

### 🎯 Path 2: Pre-computed Features (30-60 min) ⭐ RECOMMENDED
**Best for:** Real training without downloading 250GB

```bash
bash QUICK_START.sh
# Choose option 2
```

**Result:** Production-ready model (85-90% accuracy)

---

### 🔬 Path 3: Full Training (2-3 days)
**Best for:** Maximum control and experimentation

```bash
bash QUICK_START.sh
# Choose option 3
```

**Result:** Fully trained custom model

---

## Common Usage Patterns

### Social Media Content (Viral-Focused)
```bash
python scripts/4_ensemble_scene_finder.py \
    --video movie.mp4 \
    --weight-viral 0.7 \
    --weight-compelling 0.3
```

### Movie Marketing (Balanced)
```bash
python scripts/4_ensemble_scene_finder.py \
    --video movie.mp4 \
    --weight-viral 0.5 \
    --weight-compelling 0.5
```

### Story Highlights (Compelling-Focused)
```bash
python scripts/4_ensemble_scene_finder.py \
    --video movie.mp4 \
    --weight-viral 0.3 \
    --weight-compelling 0.7
```

## System Requirements

**Minimum:**
- 16GB RAM
- CPU only (will be slow)
- 50GB free space

**Recommended:**
- 32GB RAM
- NVIDIA GPU (8GB+ VRAM)

- ✅ CondensedMovies dataset in `../datasets/`

---

## Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# Activate environment
source ../viral_clip_env/bin/activate

# Quick test with dummy data
python scripts/3_train_compelling_model.py --use-dummy --num-epochs 3

# Find compelling scenes
python scripts/4_ensemble_scene_finder.py --video movie.mp4

# Evaluate trained model
python scripts/3_train_compelling_model.py --evaluate

# Custom weights
python scripts/4_ensemble_scene_finder.py \
    --video movie.mp4 \
    --weight-viral 0.7 \
    --weight-compelling 0.3
```

## What Makes This Different?

| Feature | Your Existing Viral Finder | This System |
|---------|---------------------------|-------------|
| **Training Data** | Viral social media videos | 34K+ professional movie highlights |
| **Focus** | Social media engagement | Story significance |
| **Best At** | Finding viral moments | Finding compelling scenes |
| **Result** | High viral potential | High viral + compelling |

### Combined System = Best of Both Worlds! 🌟

---

## Expected Results

### Before (Existing Viral Finder Only):
```
Top Clip: Viral score 87/100
✅ High energy
✅ Many faces
✅ Action-packed
⚠️ May not represent best movie moments
```

### After (Ensemble System):
```
Top Clip: Viral 85/100, Compelling 92/100, Ensemble 88/100
✅ Viral-worthy
✅ Story-significant
✅ Emotional impact
✅ Makes viewers want to watch movie!
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "CondensedMovies dataset not found"
```bash
# The dataset should already be in ../datasets/CondensedMovies/
# If not, download it:
cd ../datasets/CondensedMovies/data_prep/
python download.py
```

### "CUDA out of memory"
```bash
# Use smaller batch size
python scripts/3_train_compelling_model.py --batch-size 8
```

### "Model not found"
```bash
# Train the model first
python scripts/3_train_compelling_model.py --use-dummy
```

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Run `bash QUICK_START.sh` (option 1 for quick test)
2. ✅ Test on a sample video
3. ✅ Try different ensemble weights
4. ✅ Compare with your existing viral finder
5. ✅ Train on real data (option 2)
6. ✅ Deploy to production!
