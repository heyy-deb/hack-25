🚀 QUICK START (5 Minutes)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  1. Open terminal

  2. Run these commands:
     
     cd condensed_movies_integration
     source ../viral_clip_env/bin/activate
     bash QUICK_START.sh

  3. Choose option 1 (Dummy test - 5 minutes)

  4. Done! Test on your video:
     
     python scripts/4_ensemble_scene_finder.py --video /path/to/movie.mp4


🎯 WHAT THIS DOES
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  Combines TWO powerful models:
  
  1. Your existing VIRAL CLIP FINDER
     → Finds socially engaging moments
     → Optimized for Instagram/TikTok
  
  2. New CONDENSEDMOVIES MODEL
     → Trained on 34,000+ professional movie highlights
     → Finds story-significant, compelling scenes
  
  RESULT: Clips that are BOTH viral-worthy AND compelling! 🌟


📦 WHAT WAS CREATED
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  📄 7 Documentation files
  📜 5 Python scripts
  ⚙️  2 Configuration files
  📁 3 Directories (for data/models/output)
  
  Total: 13 files, fully documented, production-ready!


🎬 BASIC USAGE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  # Balanced (equal viral + compelling)
  python scripts/4_ensemble_scene_finder.py --video movie.mp4

  # Social media focus (more viral)
  python scripts/4_ensemble_scene_finder.py \
      --video movie.mp4 \
      --weight-viral 0.7 \
      --weight-compelling 0.3

  # Story focus (more compelling)
  python scripts/4_ensemble_scene_finder.py \
      --video movie.mp4 \
      --weight-viral 0.3 \
      --weight-compelling 0.7


💡 KEY FEATURES
