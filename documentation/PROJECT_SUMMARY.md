## 🎯 What This System Does

### The Problem It Solves

Your existing viral clip finder is great at finding viral moments, but may miss story-significant scenes. The CondensedMovies dataset contains 34,000+ professionally curated movie highlights - the exact kind of scenes that make people want to watch movies.

### The Solution

**Ensemble Learning:** Combine BOTH approaches!

```
Input: Movie file
       ↓
    Segment into 60-120 second clips
       ↓
For each clip:
├─→ Score for viral potential (your model)
├─→ Score for compelling-ness (CondensedMovies model)
└─→ Combine with weighted ensemble
       ↓
Output: Top N clips that are BOTH viral AND compelling!
```

### Why This Works

1. **Your Viral Model** knows what engages on social media
2. **CondensedMovies Model** knows what makes great movie moments
3. **Ensemble** = Best of both worlds! 🌟

## 💡 Key Features

### 1. Flexible Ensemble Weights
```python
# Social media focus
--weight-viral 0.7 --weight-compelling 0.3

# Balanced (marketing)
--weight-viral 0.5 --weight-compelling 0.5

# Story focus (trailers)
--weight-viral 0.3 --weight-compelling 0.7
```

### 2. Pre-configured Presets
The `ensemble_weights.json` includes:
- Social media preset (0.7/0.3)
- Marketing preset (0.5/0.5)
- Story-focused preset (0.3/0.7)
- Genre-specific presets (action, drama, comedy, etc.)

### 3. Complete Integration
- Works alongside your existing viral finder
- Uses same environment and dependencies
- No conflicts with existing code

## 📊 Technical Architecture

### Model Architecture
```
CompellingSceneClassifier
├── Input: VideoMAE embeddings (768-dim)
├── Hidden layers: [512, 256]
├── Output: Binary (compelling vs non-compelling)
└── Training: 34K+ positive + 34K negative samples
```

### Ensemble Strategy
```python
ensemble_score = (
    viral_weight × viral_score +
    compelling_weight × compelling_score
)
```

### Training Data
- **Positive samples:** All 34K clips from CondensedMovies
- **Negative samples:** Random movie segments (not in clip list)
- **Split:** 80% train, 20% validation (by movie)
- **Features:** VideoMAE + CLIP + audio + face detection
